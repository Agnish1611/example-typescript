## Contributing Design

We also have opportunities to contribute to our projects as a designer and to submit your design mockups kindly upload them as PDFs to the mockups directory. Follow along with the below guide to get started:

Your creativity is truly appreciated! We have set up some simple folders where you can upload drafts and design files for review, and usage during development.

Check out these steps for uploading a pdf export into the /mockups folder:

Export your file from your design software as a .PDF file
After you have followed the above steps to fork the repo and download the project, open up the /mockups folder and locate either draft or final depending on your current status
Then save the PDF to one of the directories, and set the title in this pattern:
[date][pagename][authorname].pdf
Then commit your changes to your local branch, push those change and open up a PR! From there you should be all good to go.
