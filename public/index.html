<!-- (2) here @jordan-pieces commented out this html here - in react projects it is best practice to actually
    take this code and use it inside a component like structure as you can see on the other components
    present on the App.tsx file -> <Header /> for example.

    Also, this disconnects the available api usage from the DOM and instead serves this static file.
    Here you can see the reversion back to the old structure of this file.

    Take a peek at the <div id="root"></div> present in the code that is here now. that is the element that is used
    as a reference from the index.tsx.

    Here is that line: const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

    then inside of App.tsx we can do the different things that we want to such as add improve styles and more and accomplish
    what I believe you were looking to accomplish!

    BTW i stored your old code here: https://jwaf.pieces.cloud/?p=282742a8b3 in case you want to reference.

    I'm going to walk you through this via the comments so following along and track the numbers! Let's go to the /components folder and open the /components/header file! -->
